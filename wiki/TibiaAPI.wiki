So really, why use it, why not make your own?
  * It is *compatible* with all of the .Net languages.
  * *Open source*
  * It is compiled and distributed as a DLL. Why is this important?
    * Unified core for many programs. All programs will run on the same underlying architecture, which, through open contribution will contain the fastest and best methods and algorithms.
    * *Easy to update.* Because all memory addresses and offsets are stored in the DLL, once it is updated any program based on it is updated as well. So, even a program that has ceased development can be updated without the original author by dropping in the newest version of the DLL.
